# Keylogger and Capturing Keystrokes

## Introduction
This project implements a basic **Keylogger** to capture and log keystrokes on a system. It records all keyboard input and logs it to a file. The project is intended for educational purposes, providing insights into how keyloggers work in cybersecurity.

> **Disclaimer:** This project should only be used for ethical purposes and with permission on systems where you have the authorization to monitor keystrokes. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.

## Features
- Captures and logs all keystrokes.
- Logs are saved to a specified file.
- Can run in the background silently (optional).
- Captures special keys like `Enter`, `Shift`, `Ctrl`, etc.
- Can record timestamps for each keystroke (optional).

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python (or the language of your choice)
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pynput` (for capturing keystrokes in Python)
  - `os` (for system-related functions)
  - `datetime` (for timestamp logging)

## How It Works
The keylogger captures every keystroke entered by the user. It uses a listener to detect each keystroke, including special keys like `Backspace`, `Enter`, `Shift`, etc., and logs them into a file. Optionally, the program can also log the timestamp for each keystroke to analyze user activity.

### Logging Flow
1. **Start Listener**: The keylogger starts a listener for capturing keyboard input.
2. **Capture Keystrokes**: Every keystroke is detected and recorded.
3. **Write to Log File**: The captured keystrokes are written into a log file for review.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Install the required libraries using the following commands:
  ```bash
  pip install pynput
